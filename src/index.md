# Context is Everything  

Data isn’t useful until it becomes *your* data.  

Dashboards and reports stop one step short of being truly helpful. They give you numbers, but not meaning. The same data can mean very different things depending on time, role, urgency, or industry.  

At Coblan, we build the **last mile**: micro tools that transform generic data into specific, actionable insights. Each tool is small, fast, and inexpensive to create — often in 15 minutes or less.

## Everyday Context Shifts  

The same number, the same chart, even the same alert — their meaning changes depending on context.  

- **12°C** is *cold* in London in July, *warm* in Oslo in January, and *critical* if you’re storing medicine.  
- **$1,000 in cloud costs** might be *noise* for a global enterprise, but a *major issue* for a startup.  
- **90% system utilization** could mean *great efficiency* for one team, but *risk of failure* for another.  

**Context turns data into information. Without it, we’re left guessing.**

## Building the Last Mile  

The last mile is where data becomes meaningful. It can be:  

- a tailored chart  
- a one-line script  
- a daily forecast in Slack  
- or even a voice response  

What matters is that it fits your role, your urgency, your situation.

## Micro Tools, Maximum Impact  

Instead of massive platforms, we build **micro tools**: focused, lightweight applications that solve *your problem, right now, in your context.*  

- Built in minutes, not months  
- Inexpensive to create and adapt  
- Easy to share and extend  

Each micro tool is simple. But in context, it’s powerful.
